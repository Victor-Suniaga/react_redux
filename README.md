This project was made so I could show that I can handle a react project with typescript. I put a stop to it since I though of a cooler project, I will call it react_redux_elevator.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner.
